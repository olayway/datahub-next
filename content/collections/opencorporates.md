## License

See https://opencorporates.com/info/licence. However, should note that most data in OpenCorporates is scraped from elsewhere so this license only covers the 'IP' that OpenCorporates has obtained as a result of their efforts (and license of original databases, e.g. Companies House in the UK, is unclear).
