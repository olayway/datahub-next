## Data

We have created [world-bank](https://datahub.io/world-bank) user specifically for World Bank datasets so they can all be found in one place.

### World Development Indicators

One of the major open ones are the [World Development Indicators][] which provide a variety of important indicators ranging from GDP and population to CO2 emissions and literacy in a standardized cross country form. We added 308 datasets from [featured indicators page][] to datahub. These datasets can be found in several main categories:

* Agriculture & Rural Development

* Aid Effectiveness

* Climate Change

* Economy & Growth

* Education

* Energy & Mining

* Environment

* External Debt

* Financial Sector

* Gender

* Health

* Infrastructure

* Poverty

* Private Sector

* Public Sector

* Science & Technology

* Social Development

* Social Protection & Labor

* Trade

* Urban Development

Some of the most popular world-bank indicators featured on our website:

* Total population of various world regions based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship. The values shown are midyear estimates https://datahub.io/world-bank/sp.pop.totl

* Cause of death, by non-communicable diseases (cancer, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, digestive diseases, skin diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and congenital anomalies) https://datahub.io/world-bank/sh.dth.ncom.zs

* Prevalence of HIV, female (% ages 15-24) https://datahub.io/world-bank/sh.hiv.1524.fe.zs

## API

The World Bank has a data API. You can use this to access a variety of data including the world development indicators.

You can get data in CSV, JSON and XML (default).

Per indicator:

```bash
https://api.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS?format=csv

# for some reason json format just yields metadata
https://api.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS?format=json
```

More elaborate queries documented in http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/first-steps-in-integrating-open-data, for example:
