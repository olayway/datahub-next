## The DBLP Computer Science Bibliography

The DBLP computer science bibliography contains the metadata of over 1.8 million publications, written by over 1 million authors in several thousands of journals or conference proceedings series.

Although DBLP started with a focus on database systems and logic programming (hence the acronym), it has grown to cover all disciplines of computer science.
